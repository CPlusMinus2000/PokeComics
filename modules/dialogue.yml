# Rules command dialogue
rules_help: States the rules of how comics work.
rules_msg: > 
    Hi!!! It's ya bot here, comin' at you with a quick heads-up: 
    The original intent behind Colin drawing these comics 
    is to entice Claudine to wake up early in the mornings. 
    Because of this, Colin decided to incentivize Claudine 
    by letting her see a new strip of his not-a-fanfiction 
    Pokémon comic when he draws them, but ONLY if she gets up 
    early enough in the morning (specifically 5:00-%s PST, %s on weekends).

    
    Because of this, the next comic might not be available yet, 
    and it'll only come out when she gets up early enough. 
    PokeComicsBot out!
